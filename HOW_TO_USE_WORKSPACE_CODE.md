# How to Use Workspace Invite Code Feature

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Copy Workspace Code (For Workspace Owner - e.g., Harish)

1. Login to your workspace (e.g., harish@gmail.com)
2. Look at the **top right panel** - you'll see a **purple box** labeled "WORKSPACE CODE"
3. Your unique code is displayed in the purple box (e.g., `939120AB`)
4. Click the **COPY** button next to the code
5. The button will turn green and show "✓ COPIED" for 2 seconds
6. Share this code with your team members (via email, chat, etc.)

**Important**: This code NEVER changes. Every time you login, you'll have the SAME code.

### Step 2: Join Workspace (For Team Members - e.g., Greesh)

#### ❌ DO NOT USE "Invite Team" Button

The blue "👥 Invite Team" button is the **OLD system**. Do NOT use it.

#### ✅ DO USE "Join Workspace" Tab

1. Login to your workspace (e.g., greesh@gmail.com)
2. Look at the **right panel** where you see tabs: "💬 Team Chat", "🤖 AI Assistant", "📋 File Info"
3. **At the bottom**, you'll see a NEW tab: **"🔗 Join Workspace"**
4. Click the "🔗 Join Workspace" tab
5. A text input field will appear with placeholder "Enter workspace code"
6. Paste the code you received from Harish (e.g., `939120AB`)
7. Click the **"JOIN WORKSPACE"** button (green button)
8. If the code is valid, you'll see: "✓ Success! Redirecting to [workspace owner]'s workspace..."
9. After 2 seconds, you'll be **automatically redirected** to Harish's workspace
10. You can now edit files and collaborate in Harish's workspace

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Code says "Invalid workspace code"

**Solution**:

- Make sure the code is exactly 8 characters
- Check that you copied it correctly (should be uppercase letters and numbers)
- Verify the code hasn't been mistyped

### Problem: Code says "Member user not found"

**Solution**:

- The person joining must have a valid account
- First signup/login on their own account
- Then use Join Workspace with the owner's code

### Problem: "You are already the workspace owner"

**Solution**:

- You can't join your own workspace
- This error means you're trying to join your own code

### Problem: Join Workspace tab not visible

**Solution**:

- Refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
- Make sure you have the latest version of the code
- Check that you're looking at the tab buttons at the bottom of the right panel

### Problem: Code changes every login

**Solution**:

- This should NOT happen
- If it does, try clearing browser cache and relogging
- The code should always be the same for the same email
